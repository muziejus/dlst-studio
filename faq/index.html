			    <h2 id="what-kinds-of-events-does-the-studio-usually-host">What kinds of events does the Studio usually host?</h2>

<p>The Studio is designed for active collaboration in digital scholarship and digital pedagogy. We host conferences, seminars, talks and workshops related to those areas, but also newer forms of collaboration: hackathons, researchathons, tech meet-ups, and more. The room is very often used for courses with a digital lab component. We also design programs around our community’s needs. If you need a particular workshop not offered elsewhere or would like to reverse-engineer a digital scholarship project, the Studio is the right venue to host a learning session around digital technologies, and we will be happy to match you with someone who can help you.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-the-studio-set-up">How is the Studio set up?</h2>

<p>The Studio may be configured for a variety of small or larger group activities. It features tables and white boards on wheels, a large screen with speakers, a digital projector, a video camera with tripod, and wireless microphones. The room may be divided up into sections or opened up for larger groups. See pictures on the CTL website of <a href="http://ctl.columbia.edu/support/workshop-planning/208b-butler-library/">various setups of the Studio</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-people-can-the-studio-accommodate">How many people can the Studio accommodate?</h2>

<p>The Studio is located in a tall, rectangular room on the south side of Butler Library that can set up in various ways. Up to ten tables can be set up for use by individual persons or by pairs; the tables can be grouped to form larger, seminar-style tables; they can be set up along the room’s perimeter for displays; or they can be folded up and rolled away to maximize open floor space.  The three white boards measure 4×6 feet and can be used to divide up the room into segments, or rolled off to the side of the room.</p>

<p>Activities in the Studio incorporating tables can accommodate up to 25 or so persons. If tables are rolled away and chairs arranged into rows, the Studio can hold up to 40 persons.</p>

<p>What technology is in the Studio?</p>

<p>The Studio is a bring-your-own-technology space. There are no computers installed in the room, but we are ready to plug your laptop in for presentations or capture events with projectors, a video camera, and microphones. Wireless connectivity has been upgraded to the fastest available in the library.</p>

<p>If you need advanced software or scanning technology for your research, that is available in the Digital Humanities Center (305 Butler); software and computers for teaching support are available in the CTL’s Learning Commons (204 Butler).</p>

<h2 id="when-is-the-studio-open">When is the Studio open?</h2>

<p>The Studio@Butler is hosted space in the library, meaning that events and activities are approved, scheduled, and managed by the GSAS Teaching Center and the Digital Humanities Center. Check the Studio@Butler calendar for recurring and upcoming activities.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-looking-for-a-good-place-to-study-individually-or-with-a-group-can-i-use-the-studio-for-that">I am looking for a good place to study (individually or with a group). Can I use the Studio for that?</h2>

<p>Studio@Butler is a place for active collaboration, training, presentation, and consultation on the practice of pedagogy and digital humanities. We welcome your ideas for group activities in Studio pertaining to this focus. To book a traditional group study or presentation practice space in Butler library, please visit the Libraries’s Room Reservation system.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-looking-for-a-space-to-convene-a-meeting-in-butler-library-is-the-studio-available-for-that">I am looking for a space to convene a meeting in Butler Library. Is the Studio available for that?</h2>

<p>If your meeting pertains to practices in teaching and learning or the digital humanities, we are happy to work with you to schedule it.  Send us a description of the event.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-bring-food-into-the-studio">Can I bring food into the Studio?</h2>

<p>Yes, you can, but you have to let us know first. Usually you will be working with a library coordinator to plan your event. Make sure you let him or her know so that they can inform the Library Information Office.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-teaching-at-columbia-and-my-class-includes-a-digital-component-may-i-hold-it-in-the-studio">I am teaching at Columbia, and my class includes a digital component. May I hold it in the Studio?</h2>

<p>The libraries do not provide classroom space at Columbia. However, the Studio may be booked for digital lab components of Columbia classes, as well as course-related training, project-building, and evaluation activities. Send us your ideas for use of the Studio in your course, and we’ll take it from there.</p>

<h2 id="is-use-of-the-studio-restricted-to-columbia-university-affiliates">Is use of the Studio restricted to Columbia University affiliates?</h2>

<p>Though events in the Studio must include a Columbia University component, they may also draw in collaborators from outside the university, such as educators at other New York City institutions, participants in NYC Digital Humanities activities, and developers connected to teaching and scholarship projects. For approved events we will work with you to set up access to the Studio for participants without Columbia University UNIs.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-have-a-question-about-the-studio-that-isnt-answered-here">What if I have a question about the Studio that isn’t answered here?</h2>

<p>Please email us your question: studio@libraries.cul.columbia.edu.</p>
