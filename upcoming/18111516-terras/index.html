			    <p>Join us at the Butler Studio on November 15, 2018 at 4PM for a talk by Melissa Terras on new work on visual culture and computational possibilities. This event is organized by Digital Scholarship at Columbia Libraries and co-sponsored by xpMethod.</p>

<h2 id="the-talk">The Talk</h2>

<p>Most Digital Humanities activity revolves around text and textual processing, although there are more and more opportunities to use 2D and 3D imaging approaches applied to primary historical sources to enable their analysis. In this talk, Terras will talk about the research relationship between the computational and engineering sciences and the cultural heritage community, and provide an overview of various projects which have seen the adoption and adaption of digitisation techniques which require data processing and analysis. What can we borrow from the computational sciences when imaging historical materials, but what can we also contribute? From the reconstruction of individual damaged texts, to the scanning of whole museums, and the intersection of machine learning and manuscript studies, Terras will discuss what it means to operate successfully in this interdisciplinary space.</p>
